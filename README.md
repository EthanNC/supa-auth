# Supabase Auth Starter

This project is based on [Supabase's Nextjs Guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/with-nextjs) but instead with email/pass auth. It also includes additional tooling I prefer like TailwindCSS and Typescript. The star of the show is `UserProvider`, which wraps most authentication logic in React Context API. I use include `react-hook-form`.

## Getting started
